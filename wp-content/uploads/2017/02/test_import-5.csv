Her ability to quickly schedule and communicate status updates was extremely helpful given the tight schedule and already stressful event of moving. With Lisa coordinating I had peace of mind and knew my move was in good hands. At the origin, Joel Lucas and team were very efficient at packing up the HHGs. At the destination, the team did a great job of quickly unpacking and setting up items.",,1/4/17,Nicole M.,5,"Brianna Beller did a wonderful job coordinating our entire move.
