                        <p> Each extra item included in your move is more money out of your pocket, which is why most people try to get rid of as much stuff as possible before they relocate.
                            This often entails emptying out the pantry, which generally results in a lot of wasted food.
                        </p>
                        <p>We've partnered with Move for Hunger to put this food to better use by donating it to local families in need. Before you throw all the stuff in your pantry out, ask us about donating it to a local food pantry</p>
